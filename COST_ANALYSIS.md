- AI response: ~150 output tokens
- **Cost per conversation: ~$0.012** (1.2 cents)

**Monthly Cost Scenarios:**

| Conversations/Day | Conversations/Month | OpenAI Cost/Month |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 10 | 300 | **$3.60** |
| 25 | 750 | **$9.00** |
| 50 | 1,500 | **$18.00** |

## Cost Optimization Options

If you want to reduce costs:

### 1. Use GPT-3.5 Turbo (85% cheaper)
- Change model to `gpt-3.5-turbo`
- Cost: ~$0.002 per conversation
- 750 conversations/month = **$1.50**

Edit `src/telegram-simple.ts:80`:
```typescript
model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',  // instead of gpt-4-turbo-preview
```

### 2. Use GPT-4o-mini (90% cheaper)
- Change model to `gpt-4o-mini`
- Cost: ~$0.001 per conversation
- 750 conversations/month = **$0.75**

### 3. Increase Poll Interval
Current: 60 seconds
Change to: 120 seconds (2 minutes)

Edit `.env`:
```
POLL_INTERVAL_MS=120000
```

This reduces Railway CPU usage slightly.

## Recommendations

âœ… **Keep current setup if:**
- Less than 50 conversations/day (~$18/month total)
- Need best Slovak language understanding
- Want highest accuracy

ðŸ’¡ **Switch to GPT-4o-mini if:**
- Budget is tight
- Volume is high (>50/day)
- Still need good Slovak support

**Estimated savings:** Up to 90% on OpenAI costs
